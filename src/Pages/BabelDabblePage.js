            Babel Dabble is the worldâ€™s first real-time, digital, and global competitive calligraphy platform. Like Words With Friends, individual users are able to challenge contacts to character writing competitions, or compete anonymously online like Xbox Live, or have classroom and school level competitions, like the National Spelling Bee. Babel Dabble gamifies Chinese literacy, motivating users to engage and practice to cultivate their own competitive advantage. Babel Dabble tackles the issues of character amnesia, difficulty recognizing characters, difficulty distinguishing between similar characters, inability to write characters from memory, and having no access to an immersive Chinese environment. The practice mode trains users to make cognitive connections and word associations that maximize retention. Our formula of social interactivity, competition, and endorphins supercharges the learner process to the point where it feels way more like a hobby than exercising academic skills.
